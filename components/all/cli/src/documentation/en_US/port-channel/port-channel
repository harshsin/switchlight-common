Configure port channel interfaces.
Each port channel interface should consist of one or more ethernet interfaces as
component interfaces. Once an ethernet interface becomes a component interface
of a port channel interface, it is no longer listed or managed as a standalone
interface, until this port channel interface is removed or reconfigured to
not include this ethernet interface.
