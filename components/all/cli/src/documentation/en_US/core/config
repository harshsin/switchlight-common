Switch to the configuration submode, allowing configuration changes
on the device.

By default, configuration changes are not written to persistent memory;
they will need to be written using the 'copy running-config startup-config'
command.

To return the device to the factory default configuration, 
'delete startup-config' and then 'reload'.
